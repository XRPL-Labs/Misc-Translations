## Base translation(s)

Base Translations are in English (**[en.json](https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/Misc-Translations/blob/main/Support-xApp-Monkdesk/en.json)**). If labels are missing in other languages, they automatically fall back to English.

The language used to render the xApp:

1. Try Xumm Language (if present)
2. Try OS Browser language (if present)
3. Fall back to default (English)

## Warnings

Please note:

- Some translations contain minor HTML (tags). This is OK. They should be left in place around whatever emphasis is added to.
- Variables are named and look like this: `{{ version }}`. Variables should stay present, but can be moved around.

# Contributing

1. Create/edit the language file (`langcode.json`), e.g. `ja.json` - if it doesn't exist:
2. If you are creating, please copy the contents of `en.json`. Use the 2-char ISO language code.
3. If you are editing, please check if new keys have been added to `en.json`, potentially missing from your language of choice
4. Make your changes. Please keep translation vars, `{{ something }}` in place, untranslated, at a location in the sentence that makes sense from a grammatical point of view
5. Copy the entire file contents, and use an [online JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) to check if it's still valid JSON
6. Submit a Pull Request
