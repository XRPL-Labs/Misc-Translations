## Base translation(s)

Base Translations are in English (**[en.json](https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/Misc-Translations/blob/main/Support-xApp-Monkdesk/en.json)**). If labels are missing in other languages, they automatically fall back to English.

The language used to render the xApp:

1. Try Xumm Language (if present)
2. Try OS Browser language (if present)
3. Fall back to default (English)

## Warnings

Please note:

- Some translations contain minor HTML (tags). This is OK. They should be left in place around whatever emphasis is added to.
- Variables are named and look like this: `{{ version }}`. Variables should stay present, but can be moved around.
